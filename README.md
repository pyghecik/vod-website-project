# Description
 Project where I've made a simple vod website that was set on showing some of mechanics that large vod websites use, such as category selection or other, 
 project wasn't set on good looking so some of the things like media queries won't work as good as it should if this was a real website.
# Techonologies used
 - React.js
 - Next.js
 - Tailwindcss
